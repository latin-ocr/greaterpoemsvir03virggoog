111. 33] T lte Georgica 91

ιο. supersit, implying a future poem, which was never completed,
but probably changed for the AEneid.

11. Aonio, see Ecl. vi. ⁶5· . ·

12. primus referam: in this passage the poet seems to have got
beyond his depth in Pindaric song, so that the figure seems harsh and
strained. 01 course sorne kind of an allegory is indicated, which is to
celebrate the triumphs of Augustus. lt is perhaps fortunate that this tem·
ple never was built, but that we have the AEneid instead, a much more
human composition- Idumaeas, put sor the East generally, to con-
trast with the scenes of Northern Italy, the poet's home. - palmas, sirn-
ply for the victories of Augustus.

16. mihi, ethical dative, in my song, or I will have, dre.

17. vietor ego: there is a great chamot-racc, which is consounded
with an intellectual race in a rather crude Pindaric figure.

19. Alpheum, the scene ol the Olympic games—Molorchi, the
host of Hercules when he went to attach the Nemean lion, hence the
allusion is to the Nemean gamos.

21. lpse, etc: the poet is to be the high priest.

22. iarn nunc, in imagination.

24. scaena, etc: plays were always a partos such festivals. -versis ι
the side scenes wereon prisms or pyramidal structures, which were turned
round to change the scene.

25. tollant, to close the scene, which was done by raising (not low-
ering) the curtare-Britanni, as the ornaments of the curtain (ln-
texti).

27. Gangaridum, a people ol India, put sor the conquest of the iar
East through the victories over Antony’s Eastern troops—Quidni,
Augustus as a second Romulus. “

29. Nilum, etc, the expedition to Egypt aster the battle os Actium.
-columuas‚ like the columna rostrata, with projecting beaks ol ships,
to commemorate the naval victories.

30. urbes: the general success of the Roman arms in the East seems
to be all that is referred to. -Niphatem a mountain of Armenia, put
for the conquest of that country, but whether the expedition of uc. 20 is
meant is very uncertain.

31. Parthum, see AEn. xi. 653 and note. Augustus’ success against
the Parthians was not exactly military, though it was in consequence of
his other military successes.

32. duo, bls: victories over the Morini and Dalmatians would fit
these words, but the allusion is not definite enough to make sure. .

33. utroque, the ocean and the Adriatic.
