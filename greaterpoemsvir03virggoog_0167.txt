THE GEORGICS.

—000-—

anourrrenuv' the original purpose of didactic poetry, to which kind
the Georgics belong, was to embody in a metrical and attractive form the
rules and precepts of some art, or the principles of some science, more
especially to aid the memory. In other words, the object ol the poet was
to instruct. Τὴε somewhat dry precepts of Hesiod hear this stamp. This
object had, however, been somewhat lost sight of even in the later Greek
didactic poetry, and the later poet sought to give a higher literary form
and a more elegant dress to subjects which might as well be treated in

prose, if the object had been merely to instruct.

It can hardly be supposed that Virgil intended to give information to

anybody who did not possess it before. His object must have been rather
to give pleasure by idealizing and ennobling the processes of an art that
his readers were* already acquainted with, and possibly to encourage the
parsuit ol the art, so far as an amateur·poetical treatment of it could do so,
by making the pursuit fashionable,—not, however, among humble sar-
mers, but among the great proprietors of land. The Romans had, become

agricultural people3 that is, their pride, as in England at this day, was in ·
the tilling os fine estates and the management of sarming operations. The
works of Cato and Varro on farming, the constant references with pride
and pleasure to this subject in the¹ works of Cicero and others, show that
agriculture, next to war and politics, was the savorite occupatiori os the
well-todo Roman.

lt is probable that Virgil or his patron Maecenas had a fancy also that
by a poetical treatment ot' the art of husbandry the humbler sarmers might
be encouraged to devote themselves to renewing the waste places of the
country, desolated by the civil wars. However this may be, doubtless

Virgil selected the topic chiefly because it afforded him an opportunity,
