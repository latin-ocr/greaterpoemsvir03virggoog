clothed with poetic sentiment and be made to appeal to those who are
familiar with the processes. The Georgics were thepoet’s second literary
ellort, being published in 29 nc, after about seven years had been devoted
to the composition, since the completion of the last Eclogue about 37 nc.
The value of the work consists in the fine poetical feeling with which he
treats natural phenomena and man’s relation to the powers which he can
engage in his service, or with which he has to contend for his life and

subsistence.
