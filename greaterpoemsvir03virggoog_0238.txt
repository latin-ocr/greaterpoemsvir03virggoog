4 Notes. [AEnsrn.

10. proxima, ie. next along the shore. -ctroaonor to the promon-
tory of Circeium, opposite the Pontine marshes, the ancients transferred the
residence of the famous enchantress Circe, visited by Ulyssem cf. iii. 386.
Her proper dwelling·place was the mythical island of AEa, off Colchis, in
the Black Sea; cf. Od. x. 135. —rsduntur, keep the emphasis in English
by changing the voice: they skins by.

11. dives, so called in imitation of Homer (cf. Od. x. 348), perhaps
originally from a vague association with the far East (cf. superbis, v. 12).
-inaooessos, the participle with the force of the adjective in -bffls, as
often. ΤῙιε idea is, “not to be safely approached.”-solisr Circe was
fabled to be the daughter of the Sun and the nymph Perseis-lucosz
here also the poet follows Homer3 cf. Od. x. 149.

12. resonat, filla, here in a causative sense, hardly found elsewhere,
but common with many other verbs. -oantu, cf. Od. x. 221. -toctis, of
the whole pala'ce.

13. urit. . .telas: the description istaken from Od. v. 57, where it
is used of Calypso.

¹4· benuls, indicating the fineness of the work.

15. hino, etc.: these changes produced by the magic art of Circe are*
famous, cf. Od. x. 135.—gemltus iraeque, angry heading, though the
Latin separates the two ideas. ’

ι6. recusantum (cf. silentum, vi. 432), spurm‘ng, ie. their unwill-
ingness to be chained is the cause of their rage.

17. praesaepibus, cages, compared to stalis for cattle.

18. ior-mae: the idea is not different from the preceding, but tbe
change is probably for metrical reasons only, though it gives the poet an
opportunity to emphasize the horror of the transformation by bringing the
forms before the eye.

20. induerat, usually with the abl. of means or the accos the thing
put on, but here with a different conception of the acti0n; cf. ln florem,
Geo. i. 187.— terga, i.e. bodies, the most prominent part being taken for
the whole (synecdoche).

21. quae, such. — talia, like thesa- monstra, horrible sate .· the
word is used of any superhuman object or occurrence, so here of the
magic change into beasts. -pii, and so not deserving such a fate; cf. iii.
266.

22. delati: this, which ought to be the main clause, is absorbed into
the principal idea, and is expressed by the participle, entering, &c

23. implevit, to prevent the necessity of coming to anchor there,
which would have been the course in case of contrary winds.

25. iarn, the next morning, when they had reached their destination.
