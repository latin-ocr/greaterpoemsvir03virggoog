marriage. -Sabtnua the eponymous founder os the Sabines, probably a
manufactured name like the preceding. He seems to have been repre·
sented with the pruning-hook, like Silvanus, to symbolize his fonctions as
god ot' vine-culture; cf. vltlsator in next verse. A representation of
Silvanus, who approaches him very nearly, is given in Fig. 124

179. servans, retaining in his statue the implement that he used as
cultivator of the vine—sub lmagtne, perhaps on the pedestal, but
possibly hanging in his hand, for which sub might be used-lani,
selected perhaps as an ancient and peculiarly Latin dinnity, having no
Greek representative.

181. vestibulo: we must imagine an open space before the house,
with a portico containing these statues. See Fig. 71, p. 140, notes to ii.
483, where the little space at the left of 1 is the vestibulum—narrowed
down, however, t0 amere entrance. ln great houses, it seems to have
been a large space occupying the same position-reges, early kings,
honored ior patriotism, but not deified like the preceding.

183. postibus: the custom of hanging trophies on the doorposts of
temples is well known.

184. curvae, such as appear in the hands of Amazons ; see Fig. 55,
v·10¹ (i- 490)·

185. portarum, of cities captured.

186. spiculaque: for quantity of e, see note, Ecl. iv. 5¹·

187. ipse: the statue of Picus was represented sitting, and in t'ull

Qulrlnali, such as Quirinus is represented with-libus, depending
grammatically on summotus, which is, however, only appropriate to
trabea, next to it,—a so·called zeugma. ΤΙιε instrument is the staff,
curved at the end, used only by the augurs. -parva, short, as compared
with other outer garments

188. trabea, an outer robe of red and white stripes, worn over the
shoulders hythe early kings, and by the knights on festive occasions, as
well as by augurs.—anclie‚ the peculiar shield carried by the Salii, put
here apparently only as an ancient form of arms.

189. equum domitor, the Homeric ἱππόδαμος, an ornamental epithet,
perhaps, to give an antique flavor to the whole-coniunx, enamored
(cf. Ecl. viii. 18), but, according to one story, she was actually his wife.

190. aurea, dissyllable.

191. avem, amagpie.

192. tall, etc, resuming the narrative from v. 168.-tntus, only an
adverb, defining more eractly the ablative of place, templo.
